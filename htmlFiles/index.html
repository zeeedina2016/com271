        <center>
        <p><i>Hallyu</i>meaning Korean culture wave, a wave of global popularity in South Korea's economy of pop culture, entertainment, music , K-Dramas( this is where it all started for me tbh) 
        and movies. According to <a href="https://martinroll.com/resources/articles/asia/korean-wave-hallyu-the-rise-of-koreas-cultural-economy-pop-culture/">Martin Roll</a>, Hallyuu is actually a chinese term with translated to "Korean Wave".
        Korean Pop itself emerged in the early 90s, and I kno you have heard "Boy with Luv" by BTS on the radio atleast once! I mean it wasn't always like that, aroudn 2013, no on ereally paid attention to Korean Pop, the one song they knew was Gangnam Style and 
        not alot of people knew that song itself was Korean. I myself was one of those people. Like I metioned before, I didn't get into KPOP till I started watching K-Dramas, my first being Boys Over FLowers.

    <p>According to <a href="https://ontheaside.com/music/a-brief-history-of-k-pop/">ontheside.com</a> Korean POp can actually be traced aal the way back to 1885, when a missionary named Henry Appenzeller taught American and British folksongs to children,
        but instead of English lyrics, he sang Korean lyrics instead. These sons were known as Changga. It was eventually banned since Korea were under the Japanese rule from 1910-1945. When Korea became North and South Korea
        Korean and Western culture came together since there were some U.S> troops that remained in the country after th end of the Korean War. Pop culture, became more accepted and 트로트( teuroteu, Trot) music became the start of the first Korean pop starts like:
